# ReturnSense AI

## AI-Powered E-commerce Return Prediction System

**Predict the probability of an e-commerce order being returned before it happens using Machine Learning.**

ReturnSense AI is an end-to-end Machine Learning application that analyzes order and customer-related information to predict return risk and provide a real-time prediction through a Flask web interface.

---

# Project Overview

Product returns create additional costs for e-commerce businesses through:

* Reverse logistics
* Shipping and handling
* Product inspection
* Restocking
* Refund processing
* Inventory disruption

ReturnSense AI aims to identify orders with a higher probability of being returned so businesses can make better operational and customer-management decisions.

---

# Business Problem

The key business question is:

> **"Can we identify an order that is likely to be returned before the return occurs?"**

A predictive return-risk system can help businesses:

* Identify high-risk orders
* Analyze return patterns
* Reduce avoidable operational costs
* Improve inventory planning
* Support targeted customer interventions
* Improve overall return management

---

# Machine Learning Objective

### Prediction Type

**Binary Classification**

### Target

```text
Return / No Return
```

The trained classification model estimates whether an order is likely to be returned.

# Key Features

* Return-risk prediction
* Machine Learning classification
* Data preprocessing pipeline
* Feature encoding and transformation
* Real-time predictions
* Flask-based web interface
* Simple prediction form
* Saved trained model

# Model Development

The project follows a structured Machine Learning workflow:

### 1. Data Preparation

* Data inspection
* Data cleaning
* Missing-value treatment
* Duplicate checking
* Data-type validation

### 2. Feature Engineering

Relevant customer, order, product and transaction characteristics are transformed into model-ready features.

### 3. Preprocessing

Categorical variables are encoded and numerical variables are transformed as required by the selected model.

### 4. Model Training

Classification algorithms are evaluated to identify an appropriate model for return prediction.

# Flask Application

The trained Machine Learning model is integrated into a Flask web application.

The application allows a user to enter order/customer information and receive a real-time prediction.

# Business Impact

ReturnSense AI can help e-commerce businesses move from:

```text
Reactive Return Management
            ↓
Predictive Return Risk Management
```

Instead of waiting for returns to happen, businesses can identify potentially high-risk orders and use the prediction as an additional input for operational planning and customer-management decisions.

---

# Future Scope

* Return probability score
* Explainable AI using SHAP
* Model monitoring
* REST API deployment
* Cloud deployment
* Customer-level return risk
* Product-level return analytics
* Return-cost prediction
* Power BI return-risk dashboard
* Automated risk alerts

---

# Project Outcome

ReturnSense AI demonstrates an end-to-end Machine Learning application:

**Data Preparation → Feature Engineering → Classification → Evaluation → Model Deployment → Real-Time Prediction**

The project combines **Machine Learning and Web Development** to convert a predictive model into a usable business application.
